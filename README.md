# A/B Testing Report: Control vs. Test Marketing Campaign

## Background and Insight
The primary objective of this A/B testing was to determine the most effective marketing strategy between two campaigns: the **Control Campaign** and the **Test Campaign**. The opportunity identified was to improve marketing ROI, increase conversion rates, and optimize the overall cost-efficiency of marketing efforts. The decision to conduct this test stemmed from a need to identify which campaign variables (e.g., ad creatives, targeting criteria, spending allocation) contribute most significantly to campaign success.

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis was that the Test Campaign, with adjusted targeting criteria and ad creative strategies, would outperform the Control Campaign in terms of Conversion Rate, CTR, CPA, and ROAS.

## Primary and Guardrail Metrics
- **Primary Metrics:** Conversion Rate, ROAS
- **Guardrail Metrics:** CTR, CPA

## Test Variant and Implementation Details
- **Control Campaign:** Utilized original ad creative and targeting criteria.
- **Test Campaign:** Implemented adjusted ad creative and refined targeting criteria based on preliminary data insights.
- **Audience Targeting:** Both campaigns were deployed across similar audience segments to ensure a fair comparison.

## Findings and Conclusions
### Conclusiveness
The test concluded with significant findings, providing clear insights into the effectiveness of both campaigns.

### Winner/Loser
The **Control Campaign** emerged as the more cost-effective strategy, disproving the initial hypothesis.

### Hypothesis Assessment
The hypothesis was disproven; the Test Campaign did not outperform the Control Campaign in terms of the primary metrics.

## Performance of Variants and Effect


- **Conversion Rate:** No significant difference was found between the campaigns.
- **CTR:** The Test Campaign achieved a higher CTR, suggesting better engagement but not necessarily higher conversion efficiency.
- **CPA:** The Control Campaign demonstrated higher cost-efficiency with a lower CPA.
- **ROAS:** The Control Campaign had a significantly higher ROAS, affirming its superior cost-effectiveness.

## Insights and Next Steps
The results suggest that the Test Campaign's adjustments did not resonate as expected, despite higher initial engagement. The Control Campaign's strategies proved to be more effective in driving revenue relative to spend.

### Why the Result?
The discrepancy in performance could be attributed to various factors, including the effectiveness of ad creatives and targeting criteria.

### Next Steps
It's recommended to further analyze aspects of the Test Campaign's strategy to understand the lack of conversion efficiency. A hybrid strategy that combines elements from both campaigns could be explored.
